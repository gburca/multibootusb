# Multiboot USB

## About

This repository stores the files needed to create a pendrive capable of booting different ISO files using GRUB2.

## Getting the files

### Using Git

If we have Git installed on the system, we can get the files directly from the repository:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/aguslr/multibootusb.git
```

After this, every time we want to update the files we do:

```sh
cd multibootusb && git pull
```

### Without Git

If Git is not installed, we can still get the files as long as we have a basic Unix environment available:

```sh
wget https://github.com/aguslr/multibootusb/tarball/master -O - | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,demo.gif}
```


## Creating the USB drive

### Using the script

Simply run as root:

```sh
./makeUSB.sh <device>
```

Where `<device>` is the name of the USB device (e.g. */dev/sdh*). Run `mount` to get this information.

**WARNING**: This will delete all data in the device, so make sure you pick the right one.


### Manually prepare the drive

#### Creating a bootable USB drive

Follow the instructions to create a [Hybrid UEFI GPT + BIOS GPT/MBR boot][efi+bios] from the ArchWiki.


#### Copying the files to the USB drive:

1. Mount the data partition:

    ```sh
    mount --target <mountpoint> <partition>
    ```

    Where `<mountpoint>` is any directory you want the partition to be mounted at, and `<partition>` is the name of the data partition (e.g. */dev/sdh3*). Run `dmesg` to get this information.

2. Create a directory named *boot* to store GRUB's configuration files, a directory named *krnl* for the kernel files and another named *isos* for the ISO files:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p <mountpoint>/boot/{grub/grub.d/,bin,krnl,isos}
    ```

3. Copy the necessary GRUB files:

    ```sh
    cd multibootusb && cp -rf {grub.cfg,grub.d,multiboot.*} <mountpoint>/boot/grub/
    ```

4. Download and copy the ISO files into the USB drive:

    ```sh
    wget "http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-1.1.0/kali-linux-1.1.0-i386.iso" -P <mountpoint>/boot/isos/
    ```

5. Reboot and select the USB drive to access the menu.


## Boot any ISO with [MEMDISK][]

[Using Syslinux's MEMDISK][usingmemdisk], an ISO file can be loaded directly into memory (as long as the system has enough) which will allow for booting some unsupported ISO's.

To get MEMDISK's binary, you can install [syslinux][] using your system's package manager, and find it at `/usr/lib/syslinux/memdisk` or `/usr/lib/syslinux/bios/memdisk`, depending on your distribution.

Alternatively, you can download the official tarball from [kernel.org][], in which case, you will find the binary at `/bios/memdisk/memdisk`.

Once you have the file, simply copy it to your data partition:

```sh
cp -f memdisk <mountpoint>/boot/grub/
```

## Figuring out the boot configuration for new ISOs

The boot options must be customized to account for the target ISO's contents. Mount the ISO and see how it boots:

```sh
mkdir /mnt/iso
mount -o loop /path/to/file.iso /mnt/iso
```

Look for `isolinux.cfg` or `grub.cfg` files in the `/mnt/iso/boot` directory and see how the ISO image is configured.

## Testing USB drive with [QEMU][]

To test the newly created USB drive in a virtual environment, run:

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -localtime -m 2G -vga std -drive file=<device>,cache=none,if=virtio
```

Where `<device>` is the name of the USB device (e.g. */dev/sdh*). Run `mount` to get this information.
